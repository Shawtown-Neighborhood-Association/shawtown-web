### Meetings

The Steering Committee has voted (electronically) in favor of conducting this Quarterly Neighborhood Meeting in-person at Newell Playground with
appropriate social distancing and mask rules. We recognize that meeting virtually has unfortunately excluded some members of our community
who are unable to participate and thank you all for accommodating us the best you could through these unprecedented times.

Please use your best judgement when deciding if participating is in the best interest of you, your family and your neighbors. If you are not
feeling well on the day of the meeting, it is recommended that you avoid joining the rest of the Neighborhood until a later date when you are feeling
better.

At this time we will continue holding the monthly Steering Committee meetings virtually and will evaluate the state of the pandemic for our next Quarterly
Meeting scheduled for **August 19th, 2021**.

- **Thursday, July 15th**

#### Upcoming Quarterly Meeting

Our next Quarterly meeting will be held on **Thursday, August 19th**.

**Please note:** August meetings are also held as our "Annual Neighborhood Meetings" and will include the formal election of the Steering Committee

### Neighborhood Clean Up (Saturday, April 24th)

The Neighborhood Association sponsored a neighborhood-wide clean up on Saturday, April 24th. Neighbors collected over 15 bags of garbage/trash between
the Ferry Street Dog Park, Newell Playground, Ferry Street, and the new park between Race Street and South Michigan. Our thanks to all of the volunteers
that gave part of their morning to clean up our beloved neighborhood.

This collaboration with the City-wide Clean Up project provided equipment, garbage disposal and amenities for the participants that drastically simplified
the planning and execution of the event. Our special thanks to Julie Booth from the Eau Claire Parks & Recreation department for all of her help and
support.

### Tree Planting (Saturday, May 1st)

The Neighborhood Association teamed up with the City of Eau Claire and its Forestry Department to help plant more than 400 new trees at the southwestern
end of the neighborhood near the Waste Water Treatment Plant. These trees replaced a large number of Ash trees that had to be removed due to the destruction
of the Emerald Ash Borer.

The team of volunteers endured the hot sunshine of our first 80 degree day to plant species of conifers, deciduous and fruit tree. Special thanks to all of
our volunteers and the Forestry Supervisor from the City of Eau Claire (Matt Staudenmaier). Additional thanks to Julie Booth, the Program Supervisor with
Eau Claire's Parks, Recreation an Forestry department for providing gloves, water and snacks for our volunteers.

### Bowl for Kids' Sake (Thursday, May 6th)

Members of our Neighborhood have teamed up to help support the Big Brothers Big Sisters of Northwestern Wisconsin (https://www.bbbsnw.org/) by forming a
team for its annual **Bowl for Kids Sake** event. We are proud to have raised over **$500** and had a fantastic time bowling together as a Neighborhood.

Next year we are planning to call out the other Neighborhood Associations around the City of Eau Claire for a friendly competition to see which Neighborhood
can raise the most money for 2022's event!
