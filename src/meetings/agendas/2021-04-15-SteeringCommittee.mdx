## New Business

### Neighborhood Thrift Sale

Many Eau Claire-area Neigborhood Associations hold annual garage/thrift sales as a benefit to its Neigborhood and the overall community. The advantage of a
Neighborhood-sponsored event means more advertising and potentially larger numbers of shoppers in attendance. Typically residents apply in advance (although not required),
so that their address and other information may be included on advertising details, and a map/flyer.

The Shawtown Neighborhood would benefit from coordinating such an event by raising awareness of the Neighborhood and its Assocation and by generating positive "traffic"
to the area.

The Eastside Hill Neighborhood Association has planned their Neighborhood-wide Thrift Sale on **Saturday, May 15th, 2021**. More information can be found here:

### Neighborhood Donation Drive

On **Saturday, April 10th** a resident of our Neighborhood lost nearly everything to a fire. The family has 3 children and will be in need of houseware items and
clothing once they have a location for which they can store whatever items are donated.

Brad Candell has been in contact with the family and would like to coordinate a "Neighborhood Donation Drive" when the family is ready to receive such goods.

### Trail Building Event

Brad Candell is looking to schedule and hold a trail building event at the Lumber Mill Park now that most of the floodwaters seem to have passed. He will be
looking for a date and volunteers to build the first part of the trail, extending just east of the mouth of Sherman Creek to the eastern most boundaries of the
property.

### Upcoming Elections

A reminder to the Steering Committee members that per our Bylaws, each of our terms are due to expire in August of 2021 (with the exception of Erin Shadbolt).
The Steering Committee must begin preparing for the nomination and election processes that we will advertise and follow when it comes time for election and/or
potential re-elections.

## Motions

### Approval of Previous Meeting Minutes

Currently pending receipt of the minutes from the 3/15/2021 Steering Committee meeting.

### Approval of Standardized List of Holiday/Events to Promote

During a previous meeting the Steering Committee discussed the annual events and Holidays that the Association would recognize through its
social media channels. We are looking to create a motion to approve the following list, or a variation of it so that it can be properly planned
through the **Information & Communications** Sub-Committee.
